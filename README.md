## Learnings

At first I didn't know where to start to learn the Sass tool, but I found the tutorial for this project and then I was able to understand in depth how Sass is used and its possibilities that I consider to be fundamental, such as: Variable configuration, Separation of components , Layout Structuring, etc.
